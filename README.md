# Zoo Keepr

A digital information management system that allows zoo administrators add to and keep track of their catalogs of animals and zookeepers.

My role was to create a back end application that handled the data management requests from an existing front end and stored all the data in a JSON file.

## Usage
* To add an animal or zookeeper to the catalog, fill in the required fields on the home page and click 'Add Animal' or 'Add Zookeeper.'
* To view the catalog of animals or zookeeper, click 'View Animals' or 'View Zookeepers.'
